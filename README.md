INSERT AN IMAGE HERE SHOWING THE GAME

This app was created to provide assistance to people looking for a new holiday destination or region. This app presents a series of questions to the user to that are 
quite general. The answers to these questions then tally up behind the scenes to general a conclusion once the series of questions come to an end, where the user will then be presented with a generated conclusion that would best fit their preferences.
My current full time job is a Flight Attendent for a long haul airline. The destinations that I have designed the questions around are the places that I travel to very frequently and know quite well. Personally, they are also my favourite destinations that I travel to and would love to share and recommend the experiences that I have here with other. However, although a little similar they do differ from eachother and dependant on whatever the user intends to do on their desired getaway.

## Introduction ##

In this project you will find the following:

1. An introduction message containing guidence to the application with a name input
2. A series of preference question with a yes or no answer option
3. A destination conclusion containing suggestions
4. An option to restart the questions if desired

**App owner goals**

* Create an engaging application that users would be inclined to come back to
* Allow the user to make their own choices
* Store and record user data and answer selections
* Make the app easy to use for users
* Create a clear understanding on the input required to users

**User Goals**

* As a first time user - I want to be able to start the application over if I wanted to
* As a first time user - I want to be given questions related to the application
* As a first time user - I want my destination generation to refect upon the preferences I have selected
* As a first time user - I want clear guidence on the type of input I am allowed to enter
* As a first time user - I want the application to be fast, easy and efficient to use


## UX/UI

### **Strategy** ###

One of the very first things I considered during the planning of this project website was who the audience would be and what they would expect/want.

**What I expect the user would be looking for:**

* Clear, concise instructions on how to use the application
* Displayed with general, interesting and relevent content
* The ability to submit input to the application
* A relevent outcome to the input given
* The option to easily try out and reset the application again

**Target Users:**

* 18 years plus
* People looking for a new destination to travel to
* People who look for multiple features when looking for a new destination to holiday
* People interested in travel
* People interested in learning a little more about other destinations

### **Scope** ###

The features added to ensure that the user gets the best and the most out of their experience are:

* An introduction message when first running the programme, containing clear and concise instructions - this contains information about what the application is for and what the purpose of the application is for.
* A user input feild where the user can enter their name - the terminal will then present a greeting message using the users inputted name to confirm that  the application has recieved the input from the user.
* A series of questions relating to destinations which the user can answer either yes or no to.
* A short conclusion is generated at the end of the questioning section where a broad destination is shown (depending on how the user answers detirmines the tally of destinations that are recorded and shown at the end). A random smaller destination within the generated country is pulled from a small list and a small overview is presented to the user.
* An option to start over and try again is located underneither the conclusion, if the user selects yes then the application will start over - if the user selects no then the user will be presented with a little thankyou message for using this application.


## Features in more detail ##

**Instructions Section**
![Instructions Section](images/rules-feature.png)

Upon launching the application the above content is displayed to the user. This contains basic and easy instructions on how to use the application and what the expected outputs and inputs will be. The instructions clearly state to the user the need to use only Y for yes and N for no when it comes to answering the questions. After the short instructions and introduction message the user is asked to input their name in the feild below.

**Questions**
![User aknowledgement and start of the questions](images/welcome-feature.png)

Once the user has entered their name, inputting only letter characters, they are they given a little message using their name input that is displayed at the top of the terminal - this acts as a way to tell the user that the application is working and is recieving and recording their inputs properly. 

The start of the questions is then presented underneith in quite an informal but still friendly mannor - the works as a way to create ease and comfort to the user. There is then a short line of instructions reminding the user that they must only answer in the following ways.
