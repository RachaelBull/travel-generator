INSERT AN IMAGE HERE SHOWING THE GAME

This app was created to provide assistance to people looking for a new holiday destination or region. This app presents a series of questions to the user to that are 
quite general. The answers to these questions then tally up behind the scenes to general a conclusion once the series of questions come to an end, where the user will then be presented with a generated conclusion that would best fit their preferences.
My current full time job is a Flight Attendent for a long haul airline. The destinations that I have designed the questions around are the places that I travel to very frequently and know quite well. Personally, they are also my favourite destinations that I travel to and would love to share and recommend the experiences that I have here with other. However, although a little similar they do differ from eachother and dependant on whatever the user intends to do on their desired getaway.

### **Strategy Plane** ###

One of the very first things I considered during the planning of this project website was who the audience would be and what they would expect/want.
